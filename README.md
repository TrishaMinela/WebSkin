# Skincare Arranger

Skincare Arranger is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to arrange their morning skincare routine by dragging and dropping skincare items. The application provides a visual representation of a vanity table where users can arrange virtual skincare products according to their preference.


## Features

- Drag and drop functionality: Users can easily move skincare items around the virtual vanity table by clicking and dragging them.
- Interactive interface: The application provides visual feedback to users as they interact with the skincare items, making it engaging and enjoyable.
- Random positioning: Skincare items are randomly positioned on the vanity table each time the application is loaded, adding an element of unpredictability.
- Feedback on correct arrangement: When users arrange the skincare items in the correct order (Cleanser, Toner, Serum, Moisturizer, and Sunscreen), they receive positive feedback indicating that they are ready for their morning skincare routine.
